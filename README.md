This repository includes Optimization algorithms, from basic ones to more complicated and effectives ones. Here is a list of the Algorithms present:
1- HookeJeeves 2 -Cyclic Coordinates 3- Golden Section 4- Dichotomous 5- Secant 6- Newton Raphson

The list starts from the most complex and effective down to the more basic and known algorithms. Both 1 and 2 work on functions containing multiple variables, whereas 3 to 6 only work on functions with 1 variable.

If there's anything not clear, or you have any ideas that could further enhance the algorithms, please contact me =)
